This is the AndiX project - Linux piggyback for Android.

With the advent of Android TV platform there is an increasing number of
boxes running relatively powerful hardware, capable of much more than
just watching movies.

The goal of this project is to have a real Linux environment running
together with Android. This will allow to get all the benefits
of Linux and Android at the same time.

The OpenWrt project (http://openwrt.org) has been choosen as the
supporting Linux distribution. It is designed for small devices with
limited resources, which somehow ressembles Android TV boxes
(because manufacturers limit hardware resources just to be enough
for home enterntainment functionality).


-= Building AndiX =-

For a quick start, just run the 'first-time-setup' script.
It will allow you to download everything needed, set up and build
a simple AndiX image which you can then run in qemu.

If you want to do more, please read Developer's Guide in OpenWrt wiki:

	https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/guide-developer

It is recommended to build additional packages for AndiX within the
OpenWrt build environment.
